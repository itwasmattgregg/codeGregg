I've been meaning to write this for a long time. I've owned both machines now
for a number of months and I wanted to do a comparison of the pros and cons of
each. For background, before these I owned a Breville smart grinder pro for
about 4 years and truly loved it. The reason I wanted to upgrade was the lack of
consistency and lack of ability to finely tune the grind. I was noticing that I
couldn't adjust the grind fine enough with the steps to get the taste where I
wanted it. I literally couldn't dial coffees in so I decided to upgrade.

The second thing I'll say is that something that is super important to me is
efficiency and process. I host many coffee events and have to kick out 20 or so
lattes each time. This means I need something reliable, consistent, and fast. I
knew this going in but I was still willing to give the Niche a try because I had
heard such praise for it, even though I knew it didn't totally fit my workflow.
