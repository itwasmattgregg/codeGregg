Recently I built a Vue app for a client that existed inside an existing
Wordpress site. The Vue app was responsible for handling a complex location
search section of the site and handled routing for a search, results, favorites,
and compare pages. But there was a problem. Even though I was creating the Vue
app conditionally based on the existence of root divs on the page, the js bundle
was being loaded everywhere and instantiating the Vue Router on every page of
the Wordpress site. This meant every url was appended with `/#/`, which was not
ideal for the client.

You might think that at this point you could just switch to the history router
instead of the hash router, but that gets insanely tricky, if not impossible
with Wordpress. Also, I had 2 main entrypoints for the Vue app. A component
(that doesn't require routing) that loads on the home page of the Wordpress
site, and the component I referenced earlier that includes routing for the main
Vue search app.

## Solution

I got around this issue by dynamically loading the router config only if I found
the DOM node for mounting the search app on the page. Here's what the code looks
like for main.js:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';

import store from '@/store';

import Search from '@/Search.vue';
import SearchAutocomplete from '@/SearchAutocomplete.vue';

/**
 * Dynamic loader that will look for registered Vue mounting points
 * and mount different Vue components
 */
function ready(fn) {
  if (
    document.attachEvent
      ? document.readyState === 'complete'
      : document.readyState !== 'loading'
  ) {
    fn();
  } else {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
  }
}

const components = {
  '#vue-search': Search,
  '#vue-search-autocomplete': SearchAutocomplete,
};

ready(() => {
  for (const selector in components) {
    const elements = document.querySelectorAll(selector);

    Array.prototype.forEach.call(elements, async el => {
      const thisComponentProps = el.dataset;

      const config = {
        el,
        store,
        render: h =>
          h(components[selector], {
            props: {
              ...thisComponentProps,
            },
          }),
      };

      // Only initialize the router if we are loading the main vue search app.
      // This is so that the hash tag in the url bar doesn't appear on other wordpress pages.
      if (el.id === 'vue-search') {
        const router = await import('./router');

        config.router = router.default;
      }

      // eslint-disable-next-line no-new
      new Vue(config);
    });
  }
});
```
