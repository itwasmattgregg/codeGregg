Sometimes you have a function with an optional Object argument that you want to
destructure in the function. Like so:

```ts
interface SomeObject {
  option1: boolean;
  stuff: boolean;
}

function foo(param?: SomeObject) {
  const { stuff } = param;
}
```

However you'll get an error because `param` could be undefined and TS doesn't
like you trying to destructure something that's undefined. There are a couple
ways around this...

Define a fallback in the initializer and don't use the ? optional identifier:

```ts
function foo(param: SomeObject = {}) {
  const { stuff } = param;
}
```

Use nullish coalescence:

```ts
function foo(param?: SomeObject) {
  const { stuff } = param ?? {};
}
```

Or just call the propery on the parameter directly with optional chaining:

```ts
function foo(param?: SomeObject) {
  anotherFunction(param?.stuff);
}
```

All of these work and will handle `param` being undefined.
