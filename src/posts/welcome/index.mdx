import Code from '../../components/Code.jsx';

I've always wanted to have a blog but have just never gotten around to it until
now. I think it will be a good practice for me to put in writing the things I
learn professionally as well as on the side. I have many hobbies and passions
and would love to share the things I learn with the world. Even though I know
well that almost none of my ideas will be original to the internet, I have
decided to share them anyways.

The first thing you should know about me is that I am on a constant hunt to
learn new things. Whether it's in web development, cooking, photography, music,
sailing, or woodworking, I could never be satsified not pushing myself to know
more. This causes me to have quite a large number of interests but I will say
it keeps my life interesting. I am driven to know, to know why, and to use that
knowledge to better the lives of those around me.
