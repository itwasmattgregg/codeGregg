This is a tutorial for quickly setting up a Github action to deploy a site to
Firebase hosting. This would include sites built with Vue, React, Gatsby, the
Next.js static generator or any other client-side site. In a few minutes you can
be set up so every time you push code to master it will automatically be built
by Github and deployed to Firebase. I'm going to assume you already have your
code on Github and a firebase project setup. If your project doesn't have a
`firebase.json` file in the root directory, or if that file doesn't have a
hosting section you may need to run `firebase init`. Also make sure you have a
`.firebaserc` file with your project ID or the deploy function won't work. If
you run `firebase init` and follow the instructions to set up hosting both files
should be created for you.

Here's an example of what the files should look like:

```json
// .firebaserc
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "project-id"
  }
}
```

`project-id` should be replaced with your project ID from the firebase console.
This is all done for you if you use the `firebase init` command from the CLI.

```json
// firebase.json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "site-name",
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`site-name` should be replaced with the name of the site you want to deploy to
(...if you want to deploy to a custom named site you created in firebase
console. If you just want to use the default site then you shouldn't include the
`site` key), and `dist` should be the directory your site gets built to. Usually
it's either dist or public.

Next you'll need to create a file called `main.yml` at the path
`.github/workflows/`. That file should have these contents:

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Archive Production Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Download Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
        with:
          args: deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

The things you may need to change here are any reference to `dist`, change to
whatever your build script outputs the final code to, and the `npm run build`
line can be changed to whatever your build command is. Note: you can easily swap
npm out with yarn, which at this time is available globally on the build
environment.

This file basically runs two separate jobs: one to build the site files from
your source code, and one to take that artifact and deploy it to Firebase
hosting.

The final piece you need here is to add your secret Firebase token to Github so
it has permission to deploy the site for you. To get this token run
`firebase login:ci` in your terminal and copy the code generated. You'll paste
that code in the settings of your Github project on the secrets page. Create a
new secret with the name `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and paste the code you got from your
terminal.

Now you can commit both files and push to Github and the Github action will take
care of the rest. After you push you should be able to see the progress in the
actions tab in your Github project.
