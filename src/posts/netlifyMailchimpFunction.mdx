You've probably heard about [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the amazing static host that literally
makes everything about static website hosting feel like a walk on the beach.
They've brought us automatic PR branch deploys, server-side [analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/),
[form submissions](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) without a server or even serverless
function, and even identity management. I do not work for Netlify but I would rarely choose
to use any other service for hosting static sites.
By the end of this tutorial you will have a working serverless function hosted on Netlify,
automatically built and deployed every time you push to git, that you can use on your static
site to add subscriber emails directly to Mailchimp.

Now they've brought us a tool called [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/),
and in this tutorial I will show you how
to use Netlify Dev to build and deploy a simple serverless function on Netlify for adding
emails to a mailchimp subscriber list through their API. The key benefit to using Netlify Dev is that
you can be sure what you test locally will be handled exactly the same way by Netlify's service
once it's deployed. Through their CLI they give you the exact same deployment tools that Netlify
uses on their end to deploy your site through the dashboard and of course, they make it super easy.
You won't have to run any deployment scripts locally to get your serverless function to Netlify, you'll
only need to push the prebuilt code to git. Plus, you get logs for your functions right in your terminal.

A quick note here on serverless functions if you don't know why we need them, if you know then
you can skip this paragraph. When we build static sites with Create React App(CRA), Vue, or Gatsby,
we are shipping all our code to the front end. This is great until you need to communicate with
a service that requires you to store and use private keys to gain access to their APIs. It would
be very bad to ship these to the client-side. Very bad. So instead we can use small Node-based
serverless (lambda) functions that we can call from our front end, and that relay our information
on to the external service. You can host these functions on many platforms like AWS, GCP, or many
others but if you're already hosting your site on Netlify why not keep everything simple?

<br />

## Getting Started

To start we're going to need a few things. You can use whatever front end framework you want
to build your client-side app. We won't focus on that right now but to start create, an app with Gatsby CLI
or the Vue CLI or CRA. You will need a Netlify account, a mailchimp account, and the latest version of the
Netlify CLI. This will allow you to run `netlify dev` from your project root, which will do a few things:

- Detect and run your site generator
- Makes environment vars from your netlify dashboard available locally on `process.env`
- Uses routing rules from Nelify or local netlify config file
- Compiles and runs cloud functions

Since we're trying to create a cloud function to connect an email submission form to mailchimp,
we'll need to create the cloud function locally. The easiest way to generate a cloud function is with
the netlify create function CLI tool like this: `netlify functions:create --name test`. This is a super
awesome command and there are a number of starter templates you can use in there
but I'm going to walk you through creating a custom one instead.

<br />

First, create this directory structure in your site root

```shell
/.netlify
  /functions
    /subscribe
      subscribe.js
...
[other site files]
```

Then navigate to the folder that contains subscribe.js and run the command:

```shell
npm init
```

Click through the setup process and at the end you will have a package.json file. We will be committing
this file because netlify can be told to recursively run `npm install` inside function directories, which
honestly is pretty cool. Most other serverless function hosts require you to compile your function locally
before deploying. Then let's install the packages we need:

```shell
npm i -S base-64 node-fetch
```

<br />

And your subscribe.js file should look like this:

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const base64 = require('base-64');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Only allow POST
  if (event.httpMethod !== 'POST') {
    return { statusCode: 405, body: 'Method Not Allowed' };
  }

  const errorGen = msg => {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: msg };
  };

  try {
    const { email } = JSON.parse(event.body);

    if (!email) {
      return errorGen('Missing Email');
    }

    const subscriber = {
      email_address: email,
      status: 'subscribed',
    };
    const creds = `any:${process.env.MAILCHIMP_KEY}`;
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://{data_center}.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/{list_id}/members/',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Accept: '*/*',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          Authorization: `Basic ${base64.encode(creds)}`,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(subscriber),
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      // NOT res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300
      return { statusCode: data.status, body: data.detail };
    }

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        msg: "You've signed up to the mailing list!",
        detail: data,
      }),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err); // output to netlify function log
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ msg: err.message }), // Could be a custom message or object i.e. JSON.stringify(err)
    };
  }
};
```

You'll need to fill in a few things at this point. Make sure you've generated an API key
on your Mailchimp account. Replace the {data_center} part of the fetch URL with the very last part
of your API key after the dash. It will be something like `us6` but will be different for everyone.
Then replace {list_id} with the Audience ID of the list you want to add subscribers to. This can be
found in the Audience Name settings page in the Audience section of Mailchimp. The last thing you need
to do is add the full API key to your Netlify dashboard, which is under domain settings. Add an environment
variable called MAILCHIMP_KEY with your API key as the value.

Next, run this command from your project root to link your site to netlify and generate the necessary state.json file.

```shell
netlify init
```

The two last things we need to do are create a netlify.toml file in the site root that looks like this:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  functions = './.netlify/functions/'
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```

This tells netlify where your functions will be located and will automatically redirect requests to /api/\*
to that directory. This is just a convenience and isn't necessary.

And you need to install `netlify-lambda` to your project root with npm and add a postinstall script to that
package.json so that netlify knows to run npm install inside of function directories at build time. The changes
to your package.json will look like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "postinstall": "netlify-lambda install",
},
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "netlify-lambda": "^1.6.2",
}
```

(note: if you just install netlify-lambda with the command line you'll get the latest version. do that.)

Then just run

```shell
npm install
```

<br />

## Running Netlify locally

Now finally if everything was done right you can run this command to get Netlify up and running locally.

```shell
netlify dev
```

It will build and start serving your site at `localhost:8888`. You now have your site built the same way
Netlify does on their services and you can call your functions locally as well. The function we wrote above can
be called at `localhost:8888/api/subscribe` with a POST request and a json body of:

```json
{
  "email": "yourEmail@gmail.com"
}
```

Go ahead and test it with postman and let me know if you have any issues.

The `netlify dev` command will also take care of hot reloading both the functions as well as the build of your site
since it just runs whatever script your app uses to develop locally (serve for Vue). It's pretty awesome running a
single command and having it hot reload both the server-side scripts as well as the front end application. The hot reloading
though will only be available at whatever that CLI hosts it at though not on the :8888 server without a refresh on the browser.

<br />

## Conclusion

That's about it. You can now push your code to github or whatever you have your site connected to Netlify with
and your API function as well as your front end application will be built and hosted on Netlify. Double-check
to make sure you have git setup to ignore node_modules and you aren't committing any API keys. Again, let me know on twitter
if you have any issues or I need to update any part of this guide. Good luck out there.
