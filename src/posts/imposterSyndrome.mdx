I know we usually reference "imposter syndrome" when we talk about jobs and the
fear that you might be exposed as a fraud who fooled their way into the position
but I've been feeling a different kind of imposter syndrome these last 7 months.
I've been undergoing treatments for Acute Myeloid Leukemia which I was diagnosed
with in december. Technically the cancer was cleared out of my body in January
but because of the nature of Leukemia it has a nasty tendency to come back
without further treatment. I went through 3 rounds of chemo and then a stem cell
transplant all of which required over 2 months of hospitalization and were not
very fun at all. However, in between treatments I looked really normal. Yes I
had lost my hair but I could wear a hat and I had lost a ton of weight, but
people who saw me immediately thought everything must be alright. I could
literally see people sigh with relief when they saw me almost as if they had
imagined I would barely be held together. The interesting thing is, some days I
feel like I'm barely held together even though I don't look it. That's what I've
decided to call cancer imposter syndrome. I feel like a cancer imposter. People
looking at me all the time like I'm normal makes me feel like I never even had
cancer even though I've gone through hell. People all see me as healthy so I
feel like I should be healthy even though I don't feel that way on the inside.
It's a really interesting feeling.
