Two weeks ago I found myself laying in a hospital bed after a full day in the
ER, a blood transfusion dripping into one of my IVs, listening to a doctor tell
me I have Acute Myeloid Leukemia. That morning I thought I was just getting over
a bad case of the flu. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I'm healthy. I can't have
cancer can I? I really wasn't in a good state that night anyways, but even so
the news hit me like a truck. I would be lying if I didn't say I was scared a
little shitless.
