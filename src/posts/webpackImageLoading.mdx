Sometimes you have to make a custom webpack config. Whether you're working on making a vue app inside
a server rendered framework like wordpress or you just decided to roll your own, this might help you
if you're having issues loading images into your components. My example will be with vue but the principal
works with other front end libraries. This will assume you already have a webpack setup and are having
difficulties getting images to import and load.

## Instructions:

Make sure you have file-loader installed along with all your other webpack dev dependencies.

```shell
npm i -D file-loader
```

Then add it to your webpack config file

```json
module: {
  rules: [
    ...

    {
      test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/,
      use: [
        {
          loader: 'file-loader',
          options: {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The final trick is to make sure to include the `publicPath` in your webpack output config object.
It will look something like this for wordpress:

```json
output: {
  filename: 'app.js',
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets/build'),
  publicPath: '/wp-content/themes/my-theme/assets/build/'
},
```

We have to not only let webpack know where to output assets from the build but also where to access them within
the grand scheme of the application (from the root path of the web server).

With publicPath added in there you can now call things like this in your Vue.js components.

```jsx
<template>
  <img :src="image" :alt="type">
</template>

<script>
import icom from '../images/icon.png';

export default {
  data: function () {
      return {
          image: icom
      }
  },
}
</script>

```
