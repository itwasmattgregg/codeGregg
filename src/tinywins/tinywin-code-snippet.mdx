Wrote an awesome VS Code snippet for starting new tiny win files in mdx. This
snippet takes the filename and capitalizes words as well as removes hyphens and
replaces them with spaces. It also inserts the current date and time for
frontmatter.

```json
{
  "tiny wins": {
    "prefix": "tinywin",
    "body": [
      "---",
      "  title: '${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE/(([\\w]*)([^\\w\\s]*)*(\\-)*)/${2:/capitalize}${3:+ }/g}}'",
      "  date: '$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:00Z'",
      "---",
      "",
      "$0"
    ],
    "description": "Create a new tiny wins mdx file"
  }
}
```
