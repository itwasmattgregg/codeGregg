Sometimes you have single digit numbers that your want to add a leading 0 to for whatever reason. 
For example if you're dealing with dates and aren't using a date library with formatting.

This simple script will take the index of the month you have (where January = 0) and return '01' 
instead of '1' and will ignore numbers with 2 digits.

```js
const twoDigitMonth = ("0" + (monthIndex + 1)).slice(-2);
```

Effectively this adds a 0 at the beginning of the string and returns 2 characters starting from the end of the string.
