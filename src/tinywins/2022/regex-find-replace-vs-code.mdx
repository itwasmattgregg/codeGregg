  title: 'Regex find and replace for VSCode'

The other day I learned a neat trick. Note this will work in many other editors as well. 
I needed to remove the type case at the end of an object in TypeScript (JavaScript) so I
created a regex to find what I wanted, an `export default {`, then whatever including line breaks,
then `} as Meta`. I grouped the part before the `as Meta` and used the group identifier `$1` in 
the VSCode replace box to replace all occurrences of my regex with everything before the `as Meta`.

Here's my find:
```
(export default \{(.|\n)*\})( as Meta)
```

Notice the parentheses around the whole first part separating it from the ` as Meta`.

Then in the replace just put `$1` to replace all occurrences with the content of the first group.
