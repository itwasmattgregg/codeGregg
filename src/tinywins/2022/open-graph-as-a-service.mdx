The other day I was looking through a repo and stumbled across someone using
Vercel's open graph image generator (https://og-image.vercel.app/), something I
had no idea existed. I was able to set it up and replace my own implementation
of something similar on my blog in an evening. My implementation involved
generating images at build time with Gatsby, why I ever thought that was a good
idea is beyond me.

This allows you generate unique open graph images for each one of your blog
posts or pages and set it in meta tags. The meta tag in my blog posts now looks
like this:

```ts
<meta
  property='og:image'
  content={OpenGraph.generateImageUrl(post.frontmatter.title)}
/>
```

Small tip here is to fork and deploy your own version of this repo so you can
change the default image. Change this line:
` if (!images[0].startsWith('https://assets.vercel.com/') && !images[0].startsWith('https://assets.zeit.co/')) {`
in `api/_lib/parser.ts`.

P.S. Also a friendly reminder that this will not work if your pages are not
viewable server-side meaning you're using straight Vue or React to render your
entire site. Each page needs to have a viewable html file stored, this is static
generation or server side generation.
