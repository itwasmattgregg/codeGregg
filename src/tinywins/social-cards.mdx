Spent the all of today creating social cards that are generated at build time
for my Gatsby blog. Most of my frustration came with trying to load a custom
font into my template loaded by puppeteer. Finally figured out that .otf fonts
don't like being base64 encoded as much as .woff fonts do. I should have turned
off my local font file sooner to debug this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. The other frustration was with
the facebook debugger which was returning a 404 for the pages I was testing.
Turns out you don't get the `path` variable in gatsby template files at the
server rendered phase. Had to switch to using the `useLocation()` hook to concat
with `siteUrl` for my og:url tag.

Will write a full blog post tutorial at some point.
