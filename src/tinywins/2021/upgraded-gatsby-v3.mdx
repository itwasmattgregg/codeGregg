I upgraded Gatsby to V3 on my personal site and am now using the new
gatsby-image-plugin. Upgrade wasn't too bad ğŸ˜ƒ took maybe an hour total. Maybe a
little more including the new gatsby image plugin initial research.

The new image plugin is pretty intuitive and I like the move to StaticImage and
DynamicImage. Use one if your image isn't based on dynamic data and the other if
it is. There hasn't been a more clearly named component ğŸ”¥
