  title: 'node-sass Is Dead'

So the other day I was updating my personal site to Node v16 and I noticed I
couldn't install node-sass. I thought it was an m1 issue so was googling down
that path but learned that people use a package called `sass` now instead of
`node-sass`. So if you're having troubles with `node-sass` make the switch.
`sass` doesn't rely on building native C code.
