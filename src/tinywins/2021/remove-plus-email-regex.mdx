Sometimes you want to strip off gmail + additions from an email. You probably
don't want to store it this way because people should definitely be allowed to
use + emails for filtering etc. but you may want to remove it to check for
duplicates or other use cases. Here's the regex for doing that.

```js
const regex = /\+(.*)(?=@)/gm;
const strippedEmail = email.replace(regex, '');
```
