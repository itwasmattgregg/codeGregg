If you're using Obsidian for editing markdown files there's a sweet keyboard
shortcut for checking checkboxes in the edit mode. You can also use this to
check multiple checkboxes at the same time instead of entering an `x` in each
`[ ]`.

Just place your cursor on the line you want to check in edit mode and type
`Cmd + Enter`. To check multiple items highlight multiple lines before hitting
`Cmd + Enter`.
