Learned that finding a simple (~free) Postgres hosted solution is kinda hard.
Heroku kinda works but for a Vercel-hosted NextJS app it was running out of
connections. Finally set up a Docker VM on Google Cloud (GCE) and that worked
pretty well even though it ended up being about $4/mo. Seems there might be some
autoscaling spin down to 0 options that might work too.
