Learned today that you can skip items when destructuring an array by using
commas and leaving the index you want to skip over blank. This can be really
helpful for certain api responses that are structured in an array, but you only
want the second item.

For example:

```js
const response = [responseInfo, body, error];

const [, body] = response;
```

In this destructuring we only want the second item from the array. Doing this
will avoid linting errors from unused variables just to get to the index you
wanted.
