  title: 'How to deal with Date Types in NextJS getStaticProps'

If you're using NextJS you're probably using the getStaticProps function or the
getServerSideProps function on your pages to fetch data to populate your page
props. Something I discovered the other day is that you can't pass some types in
your props object to your React component including the Date type. In my
particular application I'm using Prisma to get objects from my database that
include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` dates.

My code looks a little something like this:

```js
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  return { props: { users }, revalidate: 1 };
};
```

However, this was a problem because getStaticProps serializes the returned
object and Date (along with a few other types) can't be serialized. You'll get
an error like
`("[object Date]") cannot be serialized as JSON. Please only return JSON serializable data type`.
So I found this discussion on the topic
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/11498. I ended up installing a
package called `babel-plugin-superjson-next` and `superjson` and added a
`.babelrc` file with these contents:

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": ["superjson-next"]
}
```

This just fixes the issue as described in their docs:
https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson#using-with-nextjs.

Should also note here you could fix this by manually handling each Date type in
your getStaticProps method. You could map over each returned object and convert
the Date to a string before returning that array.
